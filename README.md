- **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible web framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible JSON-like format.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js, which provides schema-based solutions to model your data.
- **EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templating)**: A templating engine that lets you generate HTML with embedded JavaScript.
- **JavaScript**: The main programming language used for both client-side and server-side code.

### Additional Libraries and Tools

- **dotenv**: A module that loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`.
- **morgan**: HTTP request logger middleware for Node.js.
- **method-override**: Lets you use HTTP verbs like PUT or DELETE in places where they are not supported (e.g., HTML forms).
- **express-session**: Middleware for managing user sessions, storing data server-side.
